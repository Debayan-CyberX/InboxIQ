-- Fix the users table to work with Better Auth
-- The issue: public.users.id has a foreign key to auth.users(id), but Better Auth doesn't use auth.users
-- Solution: Remove the foreign key constraint

-- First, check if the constraint exists

    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_name,

    AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.table_schema = 'public'
AND tc.table_name = 'users'
AND tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Drop the foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE public.users 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS users_id_fkey;

-- Verify the constraint is removed
